# OpenRename

OpenRename is a local-first Windows batch renamer. It previews every filename change, blocks collisions before execution, and supports undoing the last rename plan in the current session.

Version 1.0 executes each batch as a two-phase transaction. File swaps and case-only renames are supported, every source and destination is preflighted, and a failed operation rolls staged files back to their original names instead of leaving a half-renamed batch.

Version 1.1 persists the last rename transaction in an atomic local journal. Undo survives an application restart, prepared-but-unapplied operations are ignored safely, and mixed or damaged journal states disable automatic undo instead of guessing.

Version 1.2 clears stale rename actions whenever a new preview is invalid, preventing a failed preview from leaving an older executable plan available to run. Regression tests cover a valid preview followed by an invalid one. Windows release builds run the engine tests, publish a self-contained executable, and smoke-test its launch before attaching the ZIP and SHA-256 file to the tagged release.
